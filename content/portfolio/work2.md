As Jake Knapp puts it in Sprint, the essence of the sprint is as follows:
> “When a risky idea succeeds in a sprint, the payoff is fantastic. But it’s the failures that, while painful, provide the greatest return on investment. Identifying critical flaws after just five days of work is the height of efficiency. It’s learning the hard way, without the “hard way.””

## But… What is The Design Sprint?

#### SET THE STAGE: The challenge, the team, time and space.
The client: Bloom Box (a young company founded in 2016) is looking to disrupt the online flower-gifts market by offering a customizable, one-of-a-kind product that focuses on the message, rather than the medium. They have a strong social media presence but despite the good results from the marketing efforts, the client is seeing a large drop-off rate once the users get to the product page and try to customize their Bloom Box.
The team is important, and I had the right one, because it was composed of the perfect combination of stakeholders: a product engineer, a web developer, a salesman, a designer, business analyst and a design student. Our teacher played the Decider role.
The Sprint was scheduled to one week, taking from 9am to 6pm, and placed in a large and comfortable classroom at Ironhack Madrid full of post its, papers, markers and replete of wall empty spaces.
Once the stage was set for a sprint, we began the sprint!

#### MONDAY: Make a map and choose a target
	
So, the challenge was clear: increase their conversion rate by improving the shopping experience and making the customer the center of this simple, fresh and fun process. 
But it was time to pick a more specific direction for the sprint, so we took in consider a set of the customers and statistical results obtained from the interviews and map a target, a piece of the problem we could focus on and solve in one week.
To do this, we followed the next steps:
1. Set a long-term goal.
2. List sprint questions: ask … How could we fail?
3. Draw the customers on the left and the completed goal on the right. In between, show the steps the customer would need to complete the goal.
4. Determine the How Might We…? Questions
5. Organize the HMW questions by similarities and vote to pick a target moment on the map to solve the most recurring and important ones.

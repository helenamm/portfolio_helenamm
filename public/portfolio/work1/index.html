         <h1>GV Sprint</h1>
         <p>Methodology created at Google to fast-forward into the future and see finished product and customer reaction before making any expensive commitments.
</p>

<p>As Jake Knapp puts it in Sprint, the essence of the sprint is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“When a risky idea succeeds in a sprint, the payoff is fantastic. But it’s the failures that, while painful, provide the greatest return on investment. Identifying critical flaws after just five days of work is the height of efficiency. It’s learning the hard way, without the “hard way.””</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="but-what-is-the-design-sprint">But… What is The Design Sprint?</h2>

<h4 id="1-set-the-stage-the-challenge-the-team-time-and-space">1. SET THE STAGE: The challenge, the team, time and space.</h4>

<p><strong>The client</strong>: Bloom Box (a young company founded in 2016) is looking to disrupt the online flower-gifts market by offering a customizable, one-of-a-kind product that focuses on the message, rather than the medium. They have a strong social media presence but despite the good results from the marketing efforts, the client is seeing a large drop-off rate once the users get to the product page and try to customize their Bloom Box.</p>

<p><strong>The team</strong> is important, and I had the right one, because it was composed of the perfect combination of stakeholders: a product engineer, a web developer, a salesman, a designer, business analyst and a design student. Our teacher played the Decider role.</p>

<p>The Sprint was <strong>scheduled</strong> to one week, taking from 9am to 6pm, <strong>and placed</strong> in a large and comfortable classroom at Ironhack Madrid full of post its, papers, markers and replete of wall empty spaces.</p>

<p>Once the stage was set for a sprint, we began the sprint!</p>

<h4 id="2-monday-make-a-map-and-choose-a-target">2. MONDAY: Make a map and choose a target</h4>

<p>So, the challenge was clear: increase their conversion rate by improving the shopping experience and making the customer the center of this simple, fresh and fun process.
But it was time to pick a more specific direction for the sprint, so we took in consider a set of the customers and statistical results obtained from the interviews and map a target, a piece of the problem we could focus on and solve in one week.</p>

<p>To do this, we followed the next steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Set a long-term goal.</li>
<li>List print questions: ask … How could we fail?</li>
<li>Draw the customers on the left and the completed goal on the right. In between, show the steps the customer would need to complete the goal.</li>
<li>Determine the How Might We…? Questions</li>
<li>Organize the HMW questions by similarities and vote to pick a target moment on the map to solve the most recurring and important ones.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="3-tuesday-sketch-competing-solution">3. TUESDAY: Sketch competing solution</h4>

<p>Once we had understand the problem and chose a target, it was time to focus on my favourite part: solutions! Here it is a smart move by GV, every member of the team work by their own and then we put the possible solutions in common. This works much better than shouting out ideas, because let’s be honest… Traditional brainstorming is dead.</p>

<h5 id="1-lighting-demos">1. Lighting Demos</h5>

<p>Before sketching, we started with an quick inspirational research to capture ideas. Then we put together all the inspiring components pointing the source, a simple description, and a quick drawing.</p>

<p><img src="/img/portfolio/gvsprint_02.jpg" alt="Resume of Lighting Demos" /></p>

<h5 id="2-sketching-the-four-steps">2. Sketching, the four steps:</h5>

<ul>
<li>Review notes writing the “greatest hits”</li>
<li>Generate ideas writing/drawing everything in your head with no specific formatting through a mind-map.</li>
<li>Crazy 8’s: a black sheet of paper divided in eight panel and 5 minutes to draw eight variations of ideas quickly.</li>
<li>Three-panel Storyboard drawn on post-its showing what a customer would see as they interact with the product.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/img/portfolio/gvsprint_03.gif" alt="The four sketching steps" /></p>

<h4 id="4-wednesday-decide-on-the-best">4. WEDNESDAY: Decide on the best</h4>

<p>We had a bunch of great solutions but we couldn’t prototype and test them all, so we critiqued each one, and decided which ones had the best chance of achieving our long-term goal. Instead of the traditional endless discussions and abstract debate, we used a voting in silence system that reflect the group’s goals by a stickers heat map. Finally, The Decider made the final decision by giving supervotes.</p>

<p><img src="/img/portfolio/gvsprint_04.jpg" alt="Heatmap of sketch solutions" /></p>

<p>All the sketches were related to different part of the shopping process but the three winning scenes all together could represent almost the complete flow of the user customizing and buying the product. So we reflected a series of drawings that depict a narrative sequence of Tito using the whole web, this storyboard would help us to plan the prototype.</p>

<p><img src="/img/portfolio/gvsprint_05.jpg" alt="Storyboard" /></p>

<p><em>“Tito is watching a romantic film in Netflix in his laptop when he suddenly realize that tomorrow is his anniversary and he hasn’t bought anything for his couple, Lucía. So he looks for “gift flowers couple” at Google and he notice that Bloom Box is exactly what he is looking for. So once he has checked if Bloom Box delivers in her area, he select a preset box (don’t forget he is in a hurry), and a love theme. Between all the options he likes the Valencia Pack mediterranean colours, so he chooses it and the only thing he customize is the preset box message ‘I love you’ for ‘Lucía’. He simply complete all the shipping and payment info and a confirmation is sent to his email. The email point a tracking id so he is able to locate the order whenever he wants. One day after… the Bloom Box arrives to Lucía’s and she is so delighted that she texts Tito a lot of hearts.”</em></p>

<h4 id="5-thursday-build-a-realistic-prototype">5. THURSDAY: Build a realistic prototype</h4>

<p>It’s time to validate our assumptions so we built a prototype with just enough detail to let the user click and navigate through different stages of the process.
We had just one day to build it so we took our time to pick the right tools, plan and divide the team into different roles in order to Divide and Conquer!
The assigned roles were:
- Makers, who create the components of the prototype (screens, pieces)&hellip;
- The Stitcher, who brings together the components from the makers and combine them with consistency.
- Writer, who writes every message and copy of the prototype to sound in the way we want.
- Asset Collector, who collects anything that Makers need as content: photos, icons, colors, etc.
- Interviewer, who follows the advance and prepare the interview script for the Friday test.</p>

<p><img src="/img/portfolio/gvsprint_06.jpeg" alt="Landing Page of our prototype" /></p>

<h4 id="6-friday-test-with-customer-targets">6. FRIDAY: Test with customer targets</h4>

<p>Finally we needed to verify our solutions with users and decide which ones work and will be implemented. So the last step was interviewing 5 possible customers and watching them react to our prototype. The interviewer introduced three simple tasks to the users while the rest of the team were watching and taking notes. The notes team wrote down direct quotes, observations and interpretations (positive or negative) in different colour post its.
Finally, we put all post its on the board, individually reviewed our long-term goal and sprint questions, we compared them with the patterns we saw in the interviews and wrap up some positive and negative conclusions:</p>

<p><img src="/img/portfolio/gvsprint_07.gif" alt="Notes and conclusions of the tests" /></p>

<h4 id="conclusions">CONCLUSIONS</h4>

<ul>
<li>In terms of creativity, I realized that it’s really useful bring the possible solutions together after working individually. In this way, the more reserved or impressionable people, contribute equally.</li>
<li>In terms of business, I think is priceless for a company to base the decision-making in customer validation rather than stakeholders opinion, and just in one week!</li>
<li>Designers and engineers need to show willingness to fail and accept that failure, what matters it’s the customers opinion, not yours! Say goodbye to your ideas attachment&hellip;</li>
